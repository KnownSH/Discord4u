# Vorjal

**Discord4u** is the library, and </br>
**Vorjal** is the bot its api is focused on... ***for now*** *[cue dramatic thunder]*

## What can Vorjal/Discord4u do at the moment?
TLDR: It's not really on par with discord.js or discord.py or discord.net or .. but hey, it can at least send messages!
- Websockets "work" (load bearing air quotes). It's not complete, but if you're not afraid to get your hands dirty [with this](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway-events), you can handle most events.
- The REST/HTTPS API is practically just a figment of my imagination at this point
- The codebase is absolutely unstable, "whats a sharding?"

## What do I want Vorjal/Discord4u to do?
I could rant about how I want to keep it mimimal and whatnot but let me save you some time: </br>
**I want it to do everything** </br>
Yes that is correct, i'm using this as a opportunity to completely learn the Discord API inside and out.

*Will it take me longer to program than it has taken Boeing's Starliner to reach orbit?* </br>Probably.

*Is it realistic*? </br>Depends on my mood.

There may be claims that this is some sort of AI generated slop README file, sadly it isn't, i've been without sleep for awhile, I should probably go to sleep.
